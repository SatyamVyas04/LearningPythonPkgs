## FIRE ALARM SYSTEM
#### > What is the function of a smoke detector?
A smoke detector plays a crucial role in fire alarm systems by sensing the presence of smoke particles in the air. When smoke concentration surpasses a predetermined threshold, the detector triggers the fire alarm, alerting occupants to the potential danger of a fire outbreak. Early detection allows for timely evacuation and fire response.

#### > What is the function of a heat detector?
Heat detectors are designed to monitor temperature changes (i.e looks out for a sudden sharp rise in temperature) or detect when the temperature exceeds a specific threshold. These detectors are particularly useful in environments where smoke or combustion products may not be immediately present during the early stages of a fire. Once a significant temperature rise is detected, the heat detector activates the fire alarm system, signalling the need for evacuation and emergency response.

#### > What is the function of a beam detector?
Beam detectors utilize an emitter and receiver to generate an infrared beam across a designated area. When smoke interrupts the beam, the detector triggers the fire alarm. This type of detector is commonly employed in large spaces like warehouses or atriums, where traditional spot-type smoke detectors may not be suitable due to high ceilings or airflow patterns.
