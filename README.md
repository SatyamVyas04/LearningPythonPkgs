## FIRE AS A CHEMCIAL REACTION

#### > What is a Fire?
A fire is a chemical reaction involving fuel, heat, and oxygen that produces flames, heat, light, and smoke. It requires these three elements to sustain and can have destructive or beneficial effects.

#### > What is fire triangle and what are its constituents?
The fire triangle is a model that illustrates the three necessary components for a fire to occur: heat, fuel, and oxygen. Without any one of these elements, a fire cannot sustain itself.

#### > Give three different methods of extinguishing the fire with examples
1. Water: Water can be used to extinguish fires by cooling the fire and removing heat. For example, using a fire hose to spray water on a burning building.
2. Carbon dioxide (CO2): CO2 displaces oxygen, effectively suffocating the fire. It is commonly used in fire extinguishers.
3. Foam: Foam blankets smother the fire by separating the fuel from the oxygen. They are used for flammable liquid fires, such as oil or gasoline spills.

## PORTABLE FIRE EXTINGUISHERS
#### > What are different types of fire extinguishers and where are they used?
1. Water extinguishers: Used for Class A fires (wood, paper) in homes and businesses.
2. CO2 extinguishers: Suitable for Class B and C fires (flammable liquids, electrical) in labs and areas with electrical equipment.
3. Foam extinguishers: Effective for Class A and B fires, found in workshops, garages, and areas with flammable liquids.
4. Dry powder extinguishers: Versatile for Class A, B, and C fires, commonly in vehicles, kitchens, and industrial settings.
5. Wet chemical extinguishers: Designed for Class F fires (cooking oils) in commercial kitchens.
6. Halon extinguishers: Less common now, used for Class A, B, and C fires in areas with sensitive electrical equipment.

#### > What type of extinguisher to be used in electrical fire?
The recommended type of extinguisher for electrical fires is a CO2 (carbon dioxide) fire extinguisher. CO2 extinguishers do not conduct electricity and are effective in extinguishing fires involving electrical equipment. They displace oxygen, suffocating the fire, and are safe to use on electrical fires without the risk of further damage or electrical shock.

#### > What type of extinguisher to be used in oil fires?
The recommended type of extinguisher for oil fires is a wet chemical fire extinguisher. Wet chemical extinguishers are specifically designed to handle Class F fires involving cooking oils and fats. They work by creating a cooling and smothering effect on the fire, preventing re-ignition. These extinguishers are commonly found in commercial kitchens and restaurants where the risk of oil fires is higher.

## FIRE HYDRANT SYSTEM [(Source)](https://law.resource.org/pub/in/bis/S03/is.3844.1989.html)
#### > Give five componants of Hydrant system
The five components of a hydrant system typically include:
1. Water Source: The primary component is a reliable water supply, such as a municipal water line, reservoir, or water storage tank, which provides water to the hydrant system.
2. Hydrant: The hydrant itself is an above-ground fixture that provides access to the water supply. It consists of a valve, outlet, and hose connection for firefighters to connect hoses and draw water.
3. Water Mains: Water mains are the underground pipes that distribute water throughout the area. They connect the hydrants to the water source and deliver water to the hydrant system.
4. Control Valve: A control valve is installed in the water main to control the flow of water to the hydrant system. It allows for opening or closing the water supply to individual hydrants or sections of the system.
5. Fire Hoses and Nozzles: Fire hoses are essential components that connect to the hydrants, enabling firefighters to transport water to the fire. Nozzles are attached to the end of fire hoses to regulate the water flow and spray pattern.

#### > What is a wet riser and what is its location?
A wet riser is a type of fire protection system commonly found in multi-story buildings. It consists of a vertical pipe or series of pipes that are permanently charged with water. The wet riser system is connected to a reliable water supply and has outlets at each floor level purpose being to provide a readily available water source for firefighters to access during firefighting operations in tall buildings. It eliminates the need to manually transport water to higher floors, saving time and effort. It is located within a fire riser shaft or protected enclosure in a central and easily accessible area.

#### > How many fire tanks are there in hydrant system and where are they located
1. Static Water Tank: Underground or surface water tank, constructed to store water for fire fighting purpose.
2. Terrace Task: A concrete/masonry/plastic steel tank constructed or erected on terrace of building for fire fighting purpose.
3. Priming Tank: A small tank erected in/over the pump house above the fire fighting pumps to keep the pump casing and suction of the fire pump permanently flooded.

#### > How much fire fighting pressure is required at highest point in kg/cm<sup>2</sup>?
As a general guideline, many [fire safety standards](https://www.adanielectricity.com/Tender/Uploadedfile/Corrigendum/Fire%20fighting%20Specs_20181228155441.pdf) recommend a minimum firefighting pressure of around 3.5 kg/cmÂ² (or 3.5 bar) at the highest point.

#### > How many pumps are there in a pump room? what is manual and auto running of pumps?
1. Jockey Pump: A pump of small capacity which is set to come into operation, automatically with drop in static pressure in the system and to automatically stop when the pre-set pressure is reached again.
2. Terrace Pump: An electrically driven pump, located on the terrace connected to a terrace tank with gate valve on suction side and to the internal hydrant system with non-return valve on delivery side.
3. Fire Pump: An electric/diesel pump installed at static water tank to charge the wet-riser systems.
4. Stand-by Pump: A pump of same capacity as fire pump, driven by a diesel engine or connected to any other alternate source of electric supply.

In a fire hydrant system, both manual and automatic pumps can be utilized:
1. Manual Pump: A manual pump in a fire hydrant system is operated by authorized personnel. When a fire occurs, individuals manually start the pump to provide water pressure and flow to the hydrant system. The manual pump requires human intervention to initiate its operation and control the water supply.
2. Automatic Pump: An automatic pump in a fire hydrant system is designed to start automatically when specific conditions are met. These conditions may include a drop in water pressure or the activation of fire detection systems. Once triggered, the automatic pump initiates water flow without the need for human intervention. It ensures a quick response in case of a fire emergency.

#### > What is the function of a jockey pump?
A jockey pump maintains constant pressure in a fire sprinkler system by compensating for small leaks or pressure drops. It prevents frequent starting and stopping of the main fire pump, ensuring system reliability.

#### > What is the function of a main hydrant pump?
The main hydrant pump supplies water at high pressure and flow rates to the fire hydrant system, ensuring effective firefighting capabilities. It draws water from a reliable source and boosts the pressure to extinguish fires and provide adequate water supply for firefighting operations.

#### > What is the function of a diesel(fire) pump?
A diesel pump, also known as a diesel fire pump, is designed to provide water flow and pressure in a fire protection system when the main power supply is unavailable or disrupted. It is powered by a diesel engine and functions as an alternative or backup to the electric-driven fire pumps. The diesel pump ensures the continuous operation of the fire protection system, enabling firefighting efforts during power outages or emergencies.

#### > What is the function of a booster pump?
In a fire hydrant system, a booster pump is used to augment water pressure, ensuring sufficient flow and pressure for effective firefighting operations. It compensates for low water pressure and enhances the performance of the fire hydrant system during emergencies.

#### > What are the essential accessories of a hydrant valve?
The essential accessories of a hydrant valve typically include a **valve spindle**, **operating wheel or lever**, **coupling** or connection for hose attachment, and a **cap or bonnet** to protect the valve mechanism. Other accessories may include a **strainer** to prevent debris from entering the valve, a **drain valve** to remove trapped water, and a **chain or locking device** for securing the valve in the closed or open position.

#### > What is first aid hose reel? 
A first aid hose reel is a firefighting equipment that consists of a reel with a length of hose specifically designed for first aid firefighting. It is typically mounted on a wall or in a designated location for easy access in case of small fires or emergencies. The hose reel is manually operated and provides a controlled water flow to extinguish or control fires in their early stages before they escalate. It is commonly found in buildings, offices, and public areas to facilitate immediate response to small fires.
